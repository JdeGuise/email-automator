Periodically check the 'Job Opps' folder

Note how many emails there are in the 'Job Opps' folder

If the number increases, find the difference between the old number and the new number, set the value in N

Sorting by most recently received, retrieve the email domains of the N most recent entries

Check them against the list of domains in the CSV

If they don't exist, add them to the list.



EXTENSION

	 - Michigan, Grand Rapids, Lansing, Ann Arbor, Detroit

	 - Colorado, Denver, Colorado Springs, Boulder, Greenwood, Fort Collins

	If ANY of these keywords are found, automatically add the email to the 'State' pile that matches in the CSV
